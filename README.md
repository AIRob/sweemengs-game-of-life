# Just a code to do Game of Life as an exercise

* main.py - is the game of life app for raspberry pi with sense hat. 
* main_cli.py - is game of life for for everything else
* genelab.py - the the game of life with (Bastardized) Genetic Algorithm for the raspberry pi with the sense hat
* genelab_cli.py - is for everything else

This is a little ugly, I just happen to hack it in an afternoon. The Genetic Algorithm might not be correct, I just remember what is it in the back of my head
